This is a utility for Tactician that will help you configure it correctly.
Options:

- To enable Tactician, run
  tactician enable

- To disable Tactician, run
  tactician disable

- To inject tactician into the installation or build of Coq packages, run
  eval $(tactician inject)

- After you have installed or removed the package coq-tactician-stdlib run the
  following command to help you with recompilation of other packages:
  tactician recompile
